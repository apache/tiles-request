/**
 * This package defines the concept of "request" as the event causing a
 * document to be generated from a template. The process is also called
 * "rendering the template". Typical examples are servlet requests or
 * portlet requests.
 *
 * This API is independent of the underlying technology, allowing the user
 * to deal with similarities in servlets and portlets, or various template
 * technologies, in a uniform way.
 *
 * It is based on 3 main interfaces:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.apache.tiles.request.Request} is the main abstraction,
 * encapsulating the parameters of the template (as attributes and scopes)
 * and the target document (as java.io.OutputStream).
 * {@link org.apache.tiles.request.DispatchRequest} holds some features common
 * to servlets and portlets that are unlikely to be found outside of a JavaEE
 * web environment.
 * <li>{@link org.apache.tiles.ApplicationContext} can be used to access
 * application-wide configuration and resources (typically the files containing
 * the templates).
 * <li>{@link org.apache.tiles.request.render.Renderer} is the interface supported
 * by the engine in charge of rendering the template.
 * <ul>
